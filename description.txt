This extension lets you easily edit HTML on your pages in real time so that you can quickly see
what your changes will look like without having to change source, and reload the page.

Simply press SHIFT + X to start the extension. You will see the current HTML element
you are hovering over highlight in red. If you press ENTER a dialog will allow you to edit
the HTML that currently exists in the element. (You can also click the element, but WARNING if you click a link,
it will follow the link and ruin your progress!)

Simply press SHIFT + X or ESCAPE to stop the extension and go back to the normal webpage viewing mode
